## Publication
**"Architectural Sketch to 3D Model: An Experiment on Simple-Form Houses,"** *H. B. Yang*, M. Johanes, F. C. Kim, M. Bernhard, & J. Huang, CAAD Future 2023
- Utilized Rhino Grasshopper to generate a synthetic dataset of 3D house models and corresponding hand-drawn sketches.
- Trained a deep learning network capable of generating a 3D mesh from a hand-drawn sketch and developed a pipeline to optimize the generated output.
- Constructed a web-based interface for demonstration purposes, allowing users to sketch and view the generated result directly in their browser and export it to Rhino through Grasshopper.

**"Effective Chroma Subsampling and Luma Modification for RGB Full-Color Images Using the Multiple Linear Regression Technique,"** Chung, K. L., Cheng, J. S., & *Yang, H. B.* , IEEE Access, 8, 118315-118323., Jun 2020  [(Link to Paper)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9108293)
- Proposed the initial idea of applying multiple linear regression on YUV420 subsampling to minimize the distortion.
- Successfully achieved a 1.1dB (2.5%) increase in PSNR evaluation compared to the previous state-of-the-art.
